## Fast and feature-rich Ethereum client.

**Built for mission-critical use**: Miners, service providers, and exchanges need fast synchronisation and maximum uptime. OpenEthereum provides the core infrastructure essential for speedy and reliable services.

- Clean, modular codebase for easy customisation
- Advanced CLI-based client
- Minimal memory and storage footprint
- Synchronise in hours, not days with Warp Sync
- Modular for light integration into your service or product

## Technical Overview
OpenEthereum's goal is to be the fastest, lightest, and most secure Ethereum client. We are developing OpenEthereum using the cutting-edge **Rust programming language**. OpenEthereum is licensed under the GPLv3 and can be used for all your Ethereum needs.

By default, OpenEthereum runs a JSON-RPC HTTP server on port `:8545` and a Web-Sockets server on port `:8546`. This is fully configurable and supports a number of APIs.
